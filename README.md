<br/>

## 🔧 Prerequisites

- Node.js: Install Node.js (v14.17.2 or higher) using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

- Ionic CLI: Follow the instructions [here](https://ionicframework.com/docs/cli) and Install Ionic globally with `npm` by running:

```bash
  npm install -g @ionic/cli
```

<br/>

## ✨ Quick Setup

Follow the following steps to run the app locally in your browser:

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fylein/fyle-mobile-app.git
cd fyle-mobile-app
```

2. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Set Environment Variables**: Add the environment files corresponding to the build you want in the environment folder. ([Follow Environment Setup](#-environment-setup))

4. **Run Locally**: Use the following command to run the application locally:

```bash
ionic serve -c [env_name]
```

> [!NOTE]
> Replace env_name with the name of the environment file you want to use. For example, if you > have an environment file named staging, you would run:
>
> ```bash
> ionic serve -c staging
> ```

<br/>

## 👀 Environment Setup

For setting environment variables

- **Environment Files:** Ping the mobile app team and get the necessary environment files (environment.[env_name].ts).
- Place them inside the `/src/environments` folder

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not make any changes to the `environment.ts` file - this is a template folder for creating > configurations. Also, make sure not to put staging environments in this file.

<br/>

## ❓ Troubleshooting

Here are some common issues and how to fix them:

1. If you encounter any similar error like this:
   `Property 'LIVE_UPDATE_APP_VERSION' does not exist on type ...`

```bash
  Property 'LIVE_UPDATE_APP_VERSION' does not exist on type
  '{ production: boolean; NAME: string; ROOT_URL: string; ROUTER_API_ENDPOINT: string;
  ANDROID_CLIENT_ID: string; IP_FIND_KEY: string; GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY: string; FRESHCHAT_TOKEN: string;
  SENTRY_DSN: string; REFINER_NPS_FORM_ID: string; }'
```

**Solution**:

Ensure that you have the latest environment.staging.ts file. This file might have been updated with new properties that are missing in your current version.

2. `Error: Cannot GET /` when running the app locally in the browser

This error typically occurs when some of the dependencies listed in `package.json` are not installed properly.

**Solution**:

- Delete the node_modules folder by running:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules
```

- Reinstall the dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```

This will ensure that all required packages are correctly installed, resolving the issue.

3. Unable to create PR

**Solution**:

- Ping the mobile app team for write access to the repository

## 🧪 Testing

- Run unit tests:

```bash
npx ng test
```

- For non-parallel execution (Recommended method for preventing excessive CPU utilization and memory hogging.):

```bash
npm run test:no-parallel
```

### Viewing Coverage Reports

After running the tests, you can view the test coverage report by following these steps:

- Open the generated `index.html` file present in the `app/coverage/index.html`.
- Metrics Explanation:
In this file, you will see 4 metrics for the files you have changed:

* **Statements**: Percentage of executed statements
* **Branches**: Percentage of executed branches (e.g., conditions in if, else, switch statements, `&&`, `||`, `?` operators)
* **Functions**: Percentage of executed functions
* **Lines**: Percentage of executed lines of code
- To increase code coverage, write additional test cases to cover the missing metrics.

## 📱 Running on Devices

### Android

For running the app directly on an Android device for staging

- Add .env file to project (ping mobile app team for the file)
- Build and sync the app:

```bash
ionic build -c staging
ionic capacitor run android -l --external --configuration=staging

```

2. It will open Android Studio, and let it build index files and Gradle build for some time. Then check that the studio recognized the right device in the top bar. Press the run button. After every change, you make in the `src` directory. It will automatically build the app on the device.

### iOS

For running the app directly on an ios device for staging

- Add .env file to project (ping mobile app team for the file)
- Install Xcode from the App Store
- Build and sync:

```bash
ionic build --staging
npx cap sync
npx cap open ios
```

- Open Xcode, select the connected device from the top bar and click on the run button.

## 📊 Deployment

### Running Appflow workflow manually on a private branch

- Go to the [GitHub Actions tab](https://github.com/fylein/fyle-mobile-app2/actions).
- From Workflows List, Select `Manual Workflow - Appflow`
- On the right-hand side, you can see the list of workflow runs.
- In the list view you can see a `Run Workflow` button. Click on that button
- Select the branch on which you want to run the workflow from the dropdown available for `Use workflow from`
- Click on `Run Workflow`
- This will now run the workflow on your private branch, and the Diawi APK and IPA links will be shared on Slack
